BTC single.ipynb: for generating time series plot of BTC price and log return
Calc_Acc_And_Time_Series_Plot.ipynb: the codes firstly calculate and add accumulated return of the raw data into the dataframe (csv file), and secondly use the data to generate time series plot of all indicators (there are many codes because our original plan is to illustrate 4 kinds of different plots)
Scatter_Plot.ipynb: for generating scatter plot of rt(1) vs all indicators
